I got my car jumped to go over to this shop and made the owner aware that my check engine light was on and my car had to get jumped from the gas station. I showed him the paper from AutoZone as well. He assured me that it was the starter that was the issue. He fixed it the same day and not even 24 hours later the check engine light came back on and when I went to get gas -- THE EXACT same thing occured. Which means you did not fix the original issue. It was the weekend and I had to wait to get in touch with them. He tried to charge me more stating it may be another problem and that he had no knowledge of the check engine light when he was the one who turned it off. DO NOT GO HERE!
